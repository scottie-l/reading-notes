# Javascript

A lightweight, interpreted, just-in-time, compiled program language with 1st class functions.

Javascript is not the same as Java.

Uses variables and values to render name in HTML. Ex:

First name: `<input id = "first_name">`

Last name: `<inout id = "last_name">`

var fname = document.getElementById('first_name').value;

var lname = document.getElementById('last_name').value;

Represents some code that with some tweeking would have user enter 1st and last name, then render a result on screen of name together.

var = variable

value = value

Both elements are used in Jaascript. Variables must be identified with unique names.

Identifiers can be short names like x, y, or z, or long desriptive names like age or sum.
