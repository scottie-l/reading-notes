# Growth mindset

Being able to understand that failure is just another learning opportunity. We cannot grow without failure and we can learn more from our failures than our successes sometimes.

1. I will remeber that we all have trouble with something and learn differently.
2. Things will be difficult and frustrating. That is how you know you're learning.
3. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, experiment and break things!
