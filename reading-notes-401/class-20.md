# Notes - Day 20

1. Name 5 JavaScript UI Frameworks (other than React)? Angular, jQuery, Node.js, Ember.js, & Polymer. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-most-popular-javascript-frameworks-for-web-development/">"Source"</a>

2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library? A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client. A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by sub-classing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points. <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library">"Source"</a>

3. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
  
- <u>*Rendering:*</u> Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. <a href = "seobility.net/en/wiki/Rendering">"Source"</a>
- <u>*Templates:*</u> A template is a chunk of HTML that you need to inject onto the page. Often templates are created “server side” – in that they come to the JavaScript fully formed and just need to be put into the DOM. <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/127-basics-of-javascript-templating/#:~:text=A%20template%20is%20a%20chunk,be%20put%20into%20the%20DOM.&text=In%20that%20case%20having%20the%20template%20right%20in%20JavaScript%20is%20ideal.">"Source"</a>
- <u>*State:*</u> State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation. It’s managed in the component just like any variable declared in a function. <a href = "https://medium.com/edonec/state-in-react-an-overview-a182675cee2c#:~:text=State%20is%20a%20plain%20JavaScript%20object%20used%20by%20React%20to,variable%20declared%20in%20a%20function).">"Source"</a>
