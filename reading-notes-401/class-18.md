# Notes - Day 18

1. Describe a use case for a serverless function? Multimedia processing, IoT sensor input message, Stream processing at scale, Chat bots, Batch jobs, HTTP Rest API's, CI pipeline. <a href = "https://www.itopstimes.com/cloud/10-use-cases-for-serverless/">"Source"</a>

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it? Use Events with attached event listeners or socket.io for each event to be triggered and carry out it's specified function. <a href = "https://medium.com/build-succeeded/deconstructing-aws-lambda-functions-d1597dd054cd">"Source"</a>

3. Describe how a CDN works? A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed. By caching content physically close to where a user is and reducing the distance it has to travel, latency is reduced. This process also decreases stress on origin servers by distributing the load geographically across multiple servers. <a href = "https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn#:~:text=A%20CDN%20is%20a%20network,and%20stored%20elsewhere%20as%20needed.">"Source"</a>  

4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- <u>*Serverless Functions:*</u> Serverless functions are a single-purpose, programmatic feature of serverless computing; a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider provisions computing resources on demand for its customers and manages all architectures, including cloud infrastructure. <a href = "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-are-serverless-functions.html">"Source"</a>
- <u>*Cloud Storage:*</u> Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">"Source"</a>
- <u>*CDN:*</u> A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">"Source"</a>
