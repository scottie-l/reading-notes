# Notes - Day 9

1. What header(s) are used in authentication and authorization? For basic HTTP it would be= Authorization: `<type> <credentials>`

2. What is safe to put into a JWT? The content inside the token can be trusted and verified because itâ€™s digitally signed. The signature can be generated by using both symmetric or asymmetric keys. <a href = "https://www.bbva.com/en/json-web-tokens-jwt-how-to-use-them-safely/">"Source"</a>

3. How are JWTs validated? JWTs are signed so they can't be modified in transit. When an authorization server issues a token, it signs it using a key. When the client receives the ID token, the client validates the signature using a key as well. <a href = "https://dev.to/kimmaida/signing-and-validating-json-web-tokens-jwt-for-everyone-25fb#:~:text=JWTs%20are%20signed%20so%20they,using%20a%20key%20as%20well.">"Source"</a>

4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- RBAC: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">"Source"</a>
- User Roles: User controls are containers into which you can put markup and Web server controls. <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/fb3w5b53(v=vs.100)#:~:text=User%20controls%20are%20containers%20into,derives%20from%20Control%20or%20WebControl.">"Source"</a>
- JWT Token: JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">"Source"</a>
