# Notes - Day 28

1. How do bearer tokens work? The Bearer Token is created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token. Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0. <a href = "https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/what-is-bearer-token-and-how-it-works/#:~:text=How%20bearer%20token%20works%3F,token%20used%20with%20OAuth%202.0.">"Source"</a>

2. Describe express middleware? Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. This “chaining” of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware. <a href = "https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/09/13/build-and-understand-express-middleware-through-examples#:~:text=Express%20middleware%20are%20functions%20that,or%20path)%20it's%20attached%20to.&text=This%20%E2%80%9Cchaining%E2%80%9D%20of%20middleware%20allows,code%20and%20create%20reusable%20middleware.">"Source"</a>  

3. What is a JWT? JSON Web Token or "JWT" is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.<a href = "https://jwt.io/introduction">"Source"</a>

4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- *role based access control:* RBAC allows you to create and enforce advanced access by assigning a set of permissions. The permissions are based on what level of access specific user categories require to perform their duties. <a href = "https://www.sailpoint.com/identity-library/what-is-role-based-access-control/?elqct=PaidMedia&elqchannel=GoogleSearch&elqcta=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiylgO1QQsM_EzNGLs15l7-XO8DtNYJOrlHmVbEvG-oK8AJ7U6MQGrPYaAmg5EALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiylgO1QQsM_EzNGLs15l7-XO8DtNYJOrlHmVbEvG-oK8AJ7U6MQGrPYaAmg5EALw_wcB">"Source"</a>
- *http cookies:* An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">"Source"</a>
