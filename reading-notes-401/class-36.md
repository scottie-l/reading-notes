In this article, we are given links to different pages that are made for first-time contributors ready to make their 1st contribution to a project.

People are encouraged to make a first-time contribution to an open-source project using some of the links above. There are also helpful links that discuss the code of conduct and why senior developers should be welcoming and mentoring those just starting out.
The articles are very helpful and are trying to get people involved in coding.

The largest open-source community in the world. There are millions of open-source projects on GitHub. Join one or start your own.

Open-source software is free for you to use and explore. Get involved to perfect your craft and be part of something big. Your contributions help make technology better for everyone, developers, and non-developers alike. Amazing developers use GitHub. Contribute code to projects that change how software is built. Whatever your skill level, working on open source software is a great way to learn new things.

- Browse data from over 3,800 projects on the experiences and backgrounds of those who use and build open-source software.

There are a few ways to get involved in open-source.

- Follow open-source projects
  - Learn how developers build and maintain open-source software. You can watch a project that interests you to see its progress as it happens.

- Build on great ideas
  - You don’t have to build everything from scratch. Make copies of your favorite projects, experiment in private repositories, and tailor tools and features to meet your needs.

- Contribute your skills
  - Make a suggestion, fix a bug, improve documentation, or contribute code to a project. Even asking questions helps.

GitHub isn't just a great program for version control and peer programming. It's also a fantastic place to find open-source projects that you can contribute to. Above are a list of links that will assist in finding an open-source project.

1- Improve Coding Skills.

- When developers contribute to OSS, it means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. They also free up the core developers’ schedule so they can spend that time tackling more difficult issues or improving the software in other ways.

2- Gain Early Experience.

- Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.

3- Increase Community and Peer Recognition

- Recognition from members from the OSS community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve their skills, but it can also create a number of opportunities. Another important aspect of this point is self-recognition and personal achievement.  Having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.

4- Greater Job Prospects

- The fact that OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written.

5- Improve Software on a User and Business Level.

- Often, developers find OOS as users and want to improve certain areas or by developing new features and functionalities. Even if a user isn’t a programmer, he or she can still suggest new features and functionalities to the software’s owner or core team. If a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need, then this is also a real possibility. Within every open-source project, the requirements for non-programming skills and contributions are just as necessary. Language translators, designers, and many other professionals can apply their skills and experience to improve OSS.

This global and constant collaboration is increasing open-source software’s popularity and is making the software that we use on a daily basis a whole lot better.
