# Notes - Day 16

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle? A user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user. <a href = "https://backend.turing.edu/module2/lessons/how_the_web_works_http">"Source"</a>

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC? It provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. Unlike most desktop computers, however, physical servers often include multiple CPU sockets and error correcting memory. Servers also generally support a far greater quantity of memory than most desktop computers. <a href = "https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server">"Source"</a>

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application? Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.  <a href = "https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/software-deployment/#:~:text=The%20Software%20Deployment%20Process%20Defined,on%20a%20server%20or%20device.&text=Software%20deployment%20refers%20to%20the%20process%20of%20making%20the%20application,user's%20computer%20or%20mobile%20device.">"Source"</a>

4. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- *Pub/Sub:* In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">"Source"</a>
- *WRRC:* Web Response & Request Cycle. <a href = "https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047">"Source"</a>
