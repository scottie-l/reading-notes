# Notes - Day 17

1. Describe “The Cloud” "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. <a href = "https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/">"Source"</a>

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)? Containers are executable units of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, whether it be on desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud. <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containers">"Source"</a>

3. What is auto-scaling? It's a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm, typically measured by the number of active servers, automatically based on the load on the server farm.  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling">"Source"</a>

4. What is bandwidth? It's the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)">"Source"</a>

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs? When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud. <a href = "https://www.expedient.com/knowledgebase/blog/2015-05-01-how-the-cost-of-cloud-computing-is-calculated/#:~:text=When%20setting%20price%2C%20cloud%20providers,need%20for%20its%20IaaS%20cloud.">"Source"</a>

6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- *Server Instances:* A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. <a href = "https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance#:~:text=A%20server%20instance%20is%20a,based%20or%20command%2Dline%20based.">"Source"</a>
- *Containers:* A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. <a href = "https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">"Source"</a>
- *Cloud Services:* The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. <a href = "https://www.citrix.com/solutions/digital-workspace/what-is-a-cloud-service.html">"Source"</a>
- *Cloud Architecture:* Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.  <a href = "https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-architecture.html">"Source"</a>
- *AWS:* Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/">"Source"</a>
- *EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:* Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve. <a href = "https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7">"Source"</a>
