# Notes - Day 12

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? Packets are the basic units of communication over a TCP/IP network. Devices on a TCP/IP network divide data into small pieces, allowing the network to accommodate various bandwidths, to allow for multiple routes to a destination, and to retransmit the pieces of data which are interrupted or lost. <a href = "https://kb.iu.edu/d/anyq">"Source"</a>

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this? Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't establish a connection before sending data, it just sends. Because of this, UDP is called "Connectionless". <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=+UDP+is+often+refereed+to+as+a+connectionless+protocol.+Why+is+this%3F&rlz=1C1CHZN_enUS962US962&sxsrf=AOaemvLwYdpw-CQCYFAaFNICAS2O4OHuSg%3A1643090015551&ei=X5DvYZ6AIZnI0PEP6vCpuAQ&ved=0ahUKEwjeq9elm8z1AhUZJDQIHWp4CkcQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=+UDP+is+often+refereed+to+as+a+connectionless+protocol.+Why+is+this%3F&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQAFgAYI8ZaABwAngAgAFLiAFLkgEBMZgBAKABAqABAcABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz">"Source"</a>

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? A server socket **listens** on a single port. Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to. <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11129212/tcp-can-two-different-sockets-share-a-port/11129641#:~:text=A%20server%20socket%20listens%20on%20a%20single%20port.&text=Multiple%20connections%20on%20the%20same,system%20resources%20allow%20it%20to.">"Source"</a>

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to. <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11129212/tcp-can-two-different-sockets-share-a-port/11129641#:~:text=A%20server%20socket%20listens%20on%20a%20single%20port.&text=Multiple%20connections%20on%20the%20same,system%20resources%20allow%20it%20to.">"Source"</a>
- How many sockets can an application have? For most socket interfaces, the maximum number of sockets allowed per each connection between an application and the TCP/IP sockets interface is 65535. <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=domain-maximum-number-sockets">"Source"</a>

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? Typical system configuration places the server on one machine, with the clients on other machines. The clients connect to the server, exchange information, and then disconnect. But, you can use the same socket for whatever you want, as long as your protocol handles it. <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=programming-how-sockets-work">"Source"</a>

6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Observer Pattern: The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">"Source"</a>
- Listener: A listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-addeventlistener-with-examples/#:~:text=An%20event%20listener%20is%20a,a%20key%20on%20the%20keyboard.&text=Any%20number%20of%20event%20handlers,element.">"Source"</a>
- Event Handler: Code that invokes a specific piece of code when a particular action happens. The event handler can either invoke the direct JavaScript code or a function. <a href = "https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/event-handlers-in-javascript/#:~:text=Event%20handlers%20are%20the%20JavaScript,JavaScript%20code%20or%20a%20function.">"Source"</a>
- Event Driven Programming: A programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input. This is also true of programming for device drivers. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">"Source"</a>
- Event Loop: A programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider", then calls the relevant event handler. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">"Source"</a>
- Event Queue: An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. <a href = "https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24963/event-queue">"Source"</a>
- Call Stack: A stack is a data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack".<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">"Source"</a>
- Emit/Raise/Trigger: Emit is attahced to events that will trigger other events or functions. <a href = "https://stackabuse.com/handling-events-in-node-js-with-evenemitter/">"Source"</a>
- Subscribe: The subscribe() method of the PushManager interface subscribes to a push service. It returns a Promise that resolves to a PushSubscription object containing details of a push subscription. A new push subscription is created if the current service worker does not have an existing subscription. <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe">"Source"</a> <a href = "https://jsmanifest.com/the-publish-subscribe-pattern-in-javascript/">"Ref Material"</a>
- Database: An organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">"Source"</a>
