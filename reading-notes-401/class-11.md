# Notes - Day 11

1. Why is access control important? Because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. In an I.T security setting this could translate to who can access and edit a particular file, what kinds of equipment can be used or who can access certain devices. The ultimate aim of access control is to provide a level of security that minimizes risk to a business or organization by helping to keep buildings, data and people secure. <a href = "https://premieritsolution.co.uk/the-important-of-access-control/">"Source"</a>

2. Describe an application that would need access control? Banking, insurance, employee payroll. Anything from employee HR paperwork, trade secrets and product plans, to personal customer details, the very essence of your business is based on data. Every business has data and so every business must pay close attention to how they store, access and protect this valuable asset. <a href = "https://premieritsolution.co.uk/the-important-of-access-control/">"Source"</a>

3. What is a role used for?  The role determines which permissions the system grants to the user. You can designate whether a user is an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user, and limit access to specific resources or tasks. An organization may let some individuals create or modify files while providing others with viewing permission only. <a href = "https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/role-based-access-control-rbac/">"Source"</a>

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control? It is not possible under MAC enforcement for users to change the access control of a resource. Unlike Mandatory Access Control where access to system resources is controlled by the operating system under the control of a system administrator, Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data. It is important to note that under DAC a user can only set access permissions for resources which they already own. RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role. For example, an accountant in a company will be assigned to the Accountant role, gaining access to all the resources permitted for all accountants on the system. <a href = "https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Mandatory,_Discretionary,_Role_and_Rule_Based_Access_Control">"Source"</a>

5. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- *Authorization:* Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization">"Source"</a>
- *Role Based Access Control(RBAC):* RBAC allows you to create and enforce advanced access by assigning a set of permissions. The permissions are based on what level of access specific user categories require to perform their duties. <a href = "https://www.sailpoint.com/identity-library/what-is-role-based-access-control/?elqct=PaidMedia&elqchannel=GoogleSearch&elqcta=CjwKCAiAlrSPBhBaEiwAuLSDUIXa3nNPXZ7m4DTufVavWQ3psabSNXoP9H-OdxVTb5DlwOeTqLNRbRoC4gsQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAlrSPBhBaEiwAuLSDUIXa3nNPXZ7m4DTufVavWQ3psabSNXoP9H-OdxVTb5DlwOeTqLNRbRoC4gsQAvD_BwE">"Source"</a>
- *Capabilities:* A capability is defined as a set of tasks that a system is potentially able to perform (acquired skills) at a certain performance level (available capacity). Often only with the use of external resources. <a href = "https://www.dragon1.com/terms/capability-definition">"Source"</a>
