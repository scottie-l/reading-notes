# Notes - Day 21

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS? React JS is a JavaScript library for single page applications. It allows us to create reusable components and is great for code organization. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page and uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that gives web pages interactive elements that you use to make web pages interactive.  Vanilla JS is fragile as it requires a lot of code, so it would be a little messy and that makes it less efficient than React. JS Builds page line by line from server and is sent to browser. <a href = "https://dev.to/aravsanj/how-react-works-react-vs-plain-javascript-3lm5">"Source"</a> <a href = "https://ygok17.medium.com/what-are-primary-differences-between-vanilla-js-and-react-js-2c4287ef777a">"Source"</a>

2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?  The difference between function and component is that function is what something does or is used for while component is a smaller, self-contained part of a larger entity, often refers to a manufactured object that is part of a larger device. <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+primary+difference+between+a+function+component+and+a+class+component&rlz=1C1CHZN_enUS962US962&oq=What+is+the+primary+difference+between+a+function+component+and+a+class+component&aqs=chrome.0.0i512.1404j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">"Source"</a>. A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components-in-react/#:~:text=A%20functional%20component%20is%20just,method%20used%20in%20functional%20components.">"Source"</a>

3. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- *Functional Components:* A functional component is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX). <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-components-jsx-props-for-beginners/">"Source"</a>
- *Children:* Children is a prop, and can be passed in to components in different ways. Children can be an object or an array. <a href = "https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/12/17/react-children-the-misunderstood-prop/">"Source"</a>
- *Child Components:* A child component is a more specific part inside a parent component. Example would be a parent component being a PERSON. ARMS and LEGS are child components of it. <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44092105/what-is-the-difference-between-child-and-parent-component-in-angular-2">"Source"</a>
