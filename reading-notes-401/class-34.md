# Notes - Day 34

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”? The ducks pattern and combines reducers, actions, and constants in one file called a slice. Each slice will provide an initial state and a reducer function for an object in store. <a href = "https://anil-pace.medium.com/redux-vs-redux-toolkit-58afbb9ec887">"Source"</a> Includes utilities and provides good defaults for store setup out of the box to simplify setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in. Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code. <a href = "https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">"Source"</a>

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit? It makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience. <a href = "https://redux.js.org/redux-toolkit/overview#:~:text=Redux%20Toolkit%20makes%20it%20easier,of%20skill%20level%20or%20experience.">"Source"</a>

3. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- <u>*redux toolkit slices:*</u> A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. <a href = "https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice">"Source"</a>
- <u>*namespace:*</u> Namespace refers to the programming paradigm of providing scope to the identifiers (names of types, functions, variables, etc) to prevent collisions between them. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-namespace/#:~:text=Namespace%20refers%20to%20the%20programming,a%20program%20in%20different%20contexts.">"Source"</a>
