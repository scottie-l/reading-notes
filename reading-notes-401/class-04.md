# Notes - Day 4

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development: Better programm design and higher quality, tiem required for project development, flexability and easier maintenance.

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite? The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests. <a href = "https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/the-difference-is-beforeeach-aftereach-automatically-run-before-and-after-each-tests-which-1-b53a3ba5c344">"Source"</a>

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development? The tests may be difficult to write, especially beyond the level of unit testing.

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes? A class is like a blueprint — a description of the object to be created. Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. “A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.” <a href = "https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-s-the-difference-between-class-prototypal-inheritance-e4cd0a7562e9">"Source"</a>

5. Why REST? REST is an architectural style that uses simple HTTP calls for inter-machine communication instead of more complex options like CORBA, COM+, RPC, or even SOAP. Using REST means your calls will be message-based and reliant on the HTTP standard to describe these messages. <a href = "https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/representational-state-transfer-tips">"Source"</a>

6. Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- functional programming: A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">"Source"</a>
- object-oriented programming (OOP): A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">"Source"</a>
- class: Classes are a template for creating objects. <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">"Source"</a>
- super: The super keyword in JavaScript acts as a reference variable to the parent class. It is mainly used when we want to access a variable, method, or constructor in the base class from the derived class. <a href = "https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-the-super-keyword-in-javascript">"Source"</a>
- this: The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object. <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp#:~:text=The%20JavaScript%20this%20keyword%20refers,refers%20to%20the%20global%20object.">"Source"</a>
- Test Driven Development (TDD):  a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">"Source"</a>
- Jest: Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. <a href = "https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration#:~:text=Continuous%20integration%20(CI)%20is%20the,into%20a%20single%20software%20project.&text=Automated%20tools%20are%20used%20to,crux%20of%20the%20CI%20process.">"Source"</a>
- REST: REpresentational State Transfer. It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. <a href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_restful_api.htm">"Source"</a>
- Data Model: A standardized method of properties and attributes for objects.
