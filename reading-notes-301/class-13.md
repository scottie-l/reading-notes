1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? PC's started showing up in US homes in significant numbers.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? They were able to gain experience and knowledge early, so when beginning programming they were already ahead.

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data? Males dominate the field; Highest % is 50% at one company, & only 5 are higher than 40%. White tend to be the majority in the field even more so at approximately 75%. Asian does the best out of the minority group, making up a larger portion representative of total population of 6%, while being represented in the field with over 10% in many cases.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful? When they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better? Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and faster/better ways of solving them. Racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. Consider how left-handed people would use an app, for example, 5% to 10% of videos would upload upside down as a result of not considering this. Or, if more minority people were building features or striking partnerships with Twitter, perhaps they’d have a great idea for more effectively engaging those minority users.
