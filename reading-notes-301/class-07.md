1. Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the 1st web servers that sent docs via the net. Authored a lot of research papers explianing how the internet works.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? The machines were mostly made to communicate in small groups.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? REST architectural style.

4. What does a GET do? Like the verb, it retrieves the requested data from the user, such as the web url.

5. What does a POST do? It's used to add something to another system.

6. What does PUT do? Replaces something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do? A partial update to another system.
