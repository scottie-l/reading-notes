1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL(Structured Query language)                | NoSQL(Or UnQL Unstructured Query Language)                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------                  |
| Called as relational DB (RDBMS)               | Called as non-relational or distributed DB                        |
| Table based DB's                              | Document based, key-value pairs, graph DB's or wide-column stores |
| Predefined schema                             | Dynamic schema for unstructured data                              |
| Vertically scalable                           | Horizontally scalable                                             |
| Uses SQL for defining & manipulating data     | Queries focused on collection of documents                       |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? SQL databases are good fit for complex query intensive environments. SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications.

3. Give a real world example: <a href = "https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/07/howto-install-mysql-on-linux/">"MySQL DB"</a>, MS-SQL DB, <a href= "https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/10/oracle-11g-step-by-step-installation-guide-with-screenshots/">"Oracle Enterprise Express ed"</a>.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Highly preferred for large data set. Storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.

5. Give a real world example. Hbase, <a href = "https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/install-mongodb/">"MongoDB</a>, <a href = "https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/06/install-couch-db/">"couchDB"</a>, <a href = "http://redis.io/">"Redis"</a>.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?  NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability? NoSQL. The databases are horizontally scalable, so you just add more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure. (SQL, can manage increasing load by increasing CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on single server).

1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query language.

2. What is a relational database? Works with certain assumptions. Works with tables. Each entry has unique id to relate to other tables.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? DB tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’? Defined by fields and all records must follow same schema.

5. What is a NoSQL database? They use a collection (like a table).

6. How does it work? Each collection has documents, or rows in table and don't use a structured schema.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database? Documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? Depends on if you need it scalable or complex query environments.
    - Why? There is no schema.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? May have to update collections in multiple places. Limited in how much power you can add to CPU. Can be hard to search because its schema-less.
