# Notes - Day 4

_Ch.4 "Links"_

Use `<a>` tags to create links with a href = "website" inside quotes. Add some text after the URL, but before closing tag to let user see what the link is.

Ex. `<a href = "http://website.com"> website </a>`

To get an external (absolute) site you must use the full web address, or URL (Universal Resource Locator), `https://website.com`.

For files located inside website you can just link by using file name and location.

For Email, use `<a mailto:emailaddress@email.com>Email</a>`

Target used to open window to external website. `<a href = "http://website.com" target="_blank">website</a>`

To link within a page, use `<div>` to divide up page then use h ref=id of div. `<p><a href = "top"></a><p>`

_Ch.15 "Layout"_

Block level & in-line elements.

5 positions = Normal Flow, Relative Position, Absolute Position, Fixed Position & Floating Elements.

Normal Flow: Position is static. Each block sits on top of the other. This is default in HTML.

Relative Position: Moves the element in relation to where it should have been in normal flow.

Absolute Position: When given absolute, box is taken out of normal flow & no longer affects the position of others.

Fixed Position: Like absolute, but requires values.

Overlapping Elements: Z-index= Used when boxes overlap. Use Z-index to choose which element is forward. The higher the number, the more forward it is.

Floating Elements: Move elements left or right.

Columns: Use `<div>` then width, float & margin.

Fixed width v. Liquid Layout= Fix will remain the same size, whereas liquid will stretch to fit the screen. Fix uses pixels & liquid uses %.

Screen resolution & size varies. Standard is 960-1000 pixels.

Designers use Layout grids to help divide page. Downloadable grid @ www.960.gs.(Ref. on pg 389-392, Jon Duckett, HTML & CSS.)

_Ch.3 "Functions, Methods, & Objects"_

Functions: A series of statements together to perform a specific task. To create, give it a name & then the statements needed to a achieve task.

Make parameters by placing them inside (), then telling what to do with them in the code block. The values inside the code block are called arguments.
_
Local variables are called within the function and only there.

Global variables are in memory and can be called anywhere.

2 people programming on same code. 1 person is 'driving' or do the programming, while the other is 'Navigating', or calling out the code to type, looking up solutions, going to other screens, etc. The Driver is the only one who is touching the keyboard.

4 Skills to Learn: Listen, Speaking, Reading & Writing.

Pair programming takes slightly more time, but produces much better code, reducing bugs and rework. Thus saving time overall.
