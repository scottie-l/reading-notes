# Notes - Day 2

_Ch.2 "TEXT"_

    Tags (known as markup) provide extra meaning & allow browsers to show users appropriate structure.

Structural markup

        `<h1> through <h6>`

        `<p>` paragraphs

        <b> bold
        
        <i> italics
        
        <sup> superscript characters. Those that appear in dates or math equations such as powers.
        
        <sub> subscript characters. Those that appear below and smaller such as Water h20.
        
        <br> creates line break.
        
        <hr /> horizontal line break.

Semantic markup:

        `<strong>` reads as bold with strong emphasis
        
        `<em>` reads as italics with emphasis
        
        `<blockquote> Will indent and used for long quotes.
        
        `<q> Used for short quotes and should add quote marks around statement.

        `<dfn> Used to indicate a definition of a new term.
        
        `<address> Used to contain contact info for author of page.
        
        `<ins>` `<del>` Used to insert or delete content. <ins> underlines <del> puts line through.
        
        `<s>` Item no longer accurate but still needs to be seen on page.

_Ch.10 "Introducing CSS"_

Block level elements look like they start on new line where inline elements flow within text.

CSS has 2 parts: 1- selector= which element rule applies to.

                 2- declaration= how element is referred to.

Declarations sit inside curly brackets & have a property and a value, separated by a colon.

`<link>` is used in HTML doc to tell browser where to find CSS file. `<href>` specifies path.

CSS cascades, meaning it will use the last style for an item. Add: !important to show it should be considered more important than others.

CSS Selectors can be (Ref. on pg 238, Jon Duckett, HTML & CSS.)

_Ch.2 Basic JS Instructions_

Script is a series of instructions for a computer to follow 1 by 1. Each step is known as a statement and should be separated by a semi colon.

Multi line comment /* */ used to comment out multiple lines of code.

Single line comment // used to comment out a single line of code.

Variable is keyword used with a variable name (identifier). Once created, you can assign a value to it.

Data types are numeric (numbers) strings (letters and characters) or Booleans( true false) Null & undefined.

Variable naming rules:

1. Begin with letter, $, or _. Can't begin with a number.
2. Can't use - or . in variable names
3. Can't use keywords or reserved words.
4. Variables are case sensitive
5. Use variable name that describes what it is.
6. Use capital letter on 1st letter of 2nd word. (userName)

Arrays store lists of variables, separated by commas.

Expressions evaluate a single value and use operators.

String operators use "+" to join strings together.

_Ch.4 "Decisions & Loops"_

2 components of a decision. 1. Expression is evaluated which returns a value.

                            2. Conditional statement says what to do in given situation.

== is equal to

!= is not equal to

=== strictly equal to

!== strictly not equal to

`>`= greater than or equal to

<= less than or equal to

Logical operators:

&&& logical and

|| logical or

!| logical not

if statements: evaluates a condition. If evaluates to true any subsequent code block is executed.

If else statement: if evaluates to false runs second code block.
