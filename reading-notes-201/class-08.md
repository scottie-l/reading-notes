<b>Ch.15 "Layouts" review

float= used to place boxes next to each other. When element floated, it can affect where following elelments sit.

clear= no element can touch the right or left side of boxes. Has following values:

left= no element can touch the left side containing box. right= nothing on right side of box.

both= neither left nor right can touch.

none= elements can touch either side.

Parents of floated elements are a problem. Browsers treat them as 0px tall. Solution is use 2 CSS properties/rules. 

Overflow= property given a value of 0 and width set to 100%.

For columns, create a div for each column you want. Then set width, float and margin.

For multiple style sheets, you can use the @import tag to link other style sheets to your HTML.
